# LibreConga

This is a personal project for reversing the vacuum cleaner [Conga](https://www.storececotec.com/29-robots-aspiradores) communication protocol from [Cecotec](https://www.storececotec.com/). At the moment I own one Conga model 5490.

This work is based on the one done in [https://blog.rastersoft.com/](https://blog.rastersoft.com/?cat=16). That work is for Conga 1490/1590.
